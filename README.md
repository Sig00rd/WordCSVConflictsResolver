# WordCSVConflictsResolver
Quick command line script for solving conflicting cases in CSV files storing words later to be used with Anki.
Conflicting cases here are multiple instances (lines) of words that share the same first field. Currently, cases of straight up duplicates are resolved automatically, and in cases of words sharing the first field but differing in the rest, user is prompted to choose the one to be saved.
